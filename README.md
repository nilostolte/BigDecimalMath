# BigDecimalMath
This is a repository containing examples to use Java's `BigDecimal` class, an adapted copy of Eric Oberm√ºhlner `BigDecimalMath` class and a more compact version of his [big-math](https://github.com/eobermuhlner/big-math) repository. A single program ([`BigDecimalMathExample`](BigDecimalMathExample.java)) illustrates the use of the library. The other examples show the use of some BigDecimal operations. `BigDecimal`'s `divide` and `sqrt` are shown at the start of `BigDecimalMathExample`.

## How to compile the examples

On Windows platforms just run `build.bat`. On other platforms copy the lines containing `javac` and paste them one by one on a console window.

## How to run the examples
